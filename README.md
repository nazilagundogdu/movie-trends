Movie Trends of the past 50 years


In this project, I analyze the IMDB ratings of Oscar-nominees in the past 50 years. I look at how the ratings of Oscar winners have changed over time. I also run a Linear Regression analysis of such ratings for all Oscar nominees. The data shows a subtle, but steady decline over the past 50 years.


Moreover, I run a K-means clustering of the ratings for the directors of such movies. The result of the clustering shows 4 groups of directors that fall under similar ratings.
